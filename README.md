# pythonutil

Just some random stuff that I tend to use across projects.  I've moved away from python recently,
so this doesn't get as much use as it used to, but I still use it occasionally.

The evilplot code is written by Andrew McNabb.  It's a pretty handy library for creating Gnuplot
input files from python.  I didn't see it available anywhere else, so, Andrew, if you see this and
don't like me including it here, let me know.

The dateutil code is from the python-dateutil package, available under a BSD license.
